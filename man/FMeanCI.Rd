FMeanCI(
  dir,

  internal_knots,
  k,
  alpha = 0.05,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{String containing the directory where the MCMC files are located}

\item{n_files}{Int containing the number of files per parameter}

\item{time}{Vector containing time points of interest}

\item{basis_degree}{Int containing the degree of B-splines used}

\item{boundary_knots}{Vector containing the boundary points of our index domain of interest}

\item{internal_knots}{Vector location of internal knots for B-splines}

\item{k}{Int containing the cluster group of which you want to get the credible interval for}

\item{alpha}{Double specifying the percentile of the credible interval ((1 - alpha) * 100 percent)}

\item{rescale}{Boolean indicating whether or not we should rescale the Z variables so that there is at least one observation almost completely in one group}

\item{simultaneous}{Boolean indicating whether or not the credible intervals should be simultaneous credible intervals or pointwise credible intervals}

\item{burnin_prop}{Double containing proportion of MCMC samples to get rid}
}
\value{
CI list containing the credible interval for the mean function, as well as the median posterior estimate of the mean function
}
\description{
This function calculates a credible interval with the user specified coverage.
In order to run this function, the directory of the posterior samples needs
to be specified. The function will return the credible intervals and the median
posterior estimate of the mean function at the time points specified by the
user (\code{time} variable). The user can specify if they would like the algorithm
to automatically rescale the parameters for interpretability (suggested). If
the user chooses to rescale, then all class memberships will be rescaled so
that at least one observation is in only one class. The user can also specify
if they want pointwise credible intervals or simultaneous credible intervals.
The simultaneous intervals will likely be wider than the pointwise credible
intervals.
